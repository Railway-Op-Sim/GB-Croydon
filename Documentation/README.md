# Croydon

This is a busy route covering stations in the Croydon area. It features both mainlines down from London Bridge and London Victoria, as well as many suburban services.

## Simulation

Included is a timetable of a normal Friday operation which runs between 0600 and 2000, with start points at 0600, 0800, 1000, 1200, 1400 and 1600. These individual represent the same timetable, but the start point has been altered to allow you to experience more of the timetable.

I have decided against including a session file, as there are few extra automatic routes that would be guaranteed not to be used. I urge you to experiment while operating to find optimum automatic route placements.

## Development

This project is open for contribution on the ROS GitHub Organisation, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Railway-Op-Sim).

**Big thanks to Albert for taking to time to test this project.**
